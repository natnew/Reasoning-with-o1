# Reasoning-with-o1

About This Repo
This repository is a collection of projects that demonstrate how to effectively utilise OpenAI’s o1 model for a variety of advanced tasks. Each project showcases the model’s strengths and explores practical strategies for optimising its use in complex reasoning scenarios.

### What’s Included
Task Suitability: Projects that help identify when to use the o1 model, when smaller or faster models might be more appropriate, and how to combine them for maximum efficiency.
Prompting Principles: Examples that highlight four essential principles of effective prompting, from simplicity to providing examples, with an analysis of their impact on performance.
Multi-Step Task Implementation: Demonstrations of how to use o1 as a planner, delegating tasks to smaller models like 4o-mini to execute them, balancing cost and intelligence.
Coding Applications: Projects that involve solving coding challenges, building new applications, and comparing model performances in tasks such as editing and testing code.
Image Understanding: Applications that showcase o1’s ability to preprocess and index images with detailed reasoning, enabling efficient Q&A with rich contextual insights.
Meta-Prompting: Techniques for improving prompts iteratively using o1, including projects that refine customer support prompts for better performance.


## Setup

- install the requirements from `requirements.txt`

- rename `.streamlit/_secrets.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and place your secrets there
